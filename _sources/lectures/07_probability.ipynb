    "## Uncertainty & Importance of Probability Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "We have seen that dealing with data means dealing with \"some variables\n",
    "assuming some values\".\n",
    "\n",
    "However, **what can we say about what values such variables will assume**?\n",
    "\n",
    "In some cases, it is possible to predict the values of these variables\n",
    "with perfect accuracy, given a set of initial conditions. For instance,\n",
    "think about a system of equations describing the *speed of objects\n",
    "according to Newtonian laws*.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other cases, modeling the relationship between variables in a\n",
    "deterministic way is not possible. We often say that this is due to **uncertainty**.\n",
    "\n",
    "As reported [here](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/contents/prob.html), **uncertainty in a system can be due to different factors**:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Inherent stochasticity in the system being modeled.** Some events such as *drawing a card from a deck of cards*, *rolling a die*, or the movements of subatomic particles can be seen as truly random events. The outcomes of such events cannot be predicted with perfect accuracy, so they are stochastic (random).\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Incomplete observability.** Sometimes, even in a deterministic system, we cannot observe anything. For instance, *in the Monty Hall problem, the participant to the game is asked to choose between three doors*. One of the doors contains a prize, while the others lead to a goat. Even if the event is deterministic, the game contestant cannot observe everything, so from their point of view, the outcome is uncertain.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Incomplete modeling.** Sometimes a system has to discard some of the information needed to make a decision. For instance, imagine a robotic system aiming to pick objects from a table with a single RGB camera. *The system cannot reconstruct the 3D position of the objects, but the RGB camera an allow to obtain an estimate of the 2D coordinates of each objects with respect to the robot's point of view*. All the information which cannot be observed is uncertain, despite the problem is a deterministic one.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Tossing a coin or rolling a die**: these kinds of experiments are\n",
    "    generally impossible to model in a deterministic way. This can be\n",
    "    due to our limited ability to model the event (i.e., rolling a die\n",
    "    might be deterministic, but deriving a set of equations to determine\n",
    "    the outcome given the initial motion of the hand is intractable).\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Determining if a patient has a given pathology**: different\n",
    "    pathologies might have similar symptoms. Hence, observing some of\n",
    "    them does not allow to determine with perfect accuracy if the\n",
    "    patient has that pathology. In this case, uncertainty might arise\n",
    "    from incomplete observability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Importance of Probability Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "Probability theory provides a consistent framework to work with\n",
    "uncertain events.\n",
    "\n",
    "It allows to quantify and manipulate uncertainty with a set of axioms,\n",
    "as well as to derive new uncertain statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Probability theory is hence **an important tool to work with data**. We\n",
    "will start to revise the main concepts behind probability theory by\n",
    "talking about random variables."

    "### Random Experiments\n",
    "In practice, when the acquisition of data is affected by uncertainty, we will use the term **random experiment**. We will informally define a random experiment as:\n",
    "\n",
    "> An experiment which can be repeated any number of times, leading to different outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the following terminology:\n",
    "* **sample space** $\\Omega = \\{\\omega_1,\\ldots,\\omega_k\\}$: the set of all possible outcomes of the experiment;\n",
    "* **simple event** $\\omega_i$: a possible outcome of a random experiment;\n",
    "* **event** $A \\subseteq \\Omega$: a subset of the sample space including certain events. We usually denote $\\overline A = \\Omega \\setminus A$ as the complementary event to $A$, i.e., the event that $A$ does not happen.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the definitions above, $\\Omega$ is often called the **sure event** or **certain event**, because it contains all possible outcomes. The null set $\\emptyset$ is called the **impossible event**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example\n",
    "Let us consider the random experiment of rolling a die. Our outcomes will be numbers which we read on the top face of the die when it lands. We will have:\n",
    "* Sample space: $\\Omega=\\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}$;\n",
    "* Simple event: an example of a simple event would be $\\omega_1=1$;\n",
    "* Event: the event \"we obtain 1\" could be denoted by $A=\\{1\\}$. The event \"we obtain an even number\" can be denoted by $A=\\{2,4,6\\}$. We would have $\\overline A = \\{1,3,5\\}$, the event that \"we obtain an odd number\"."

    "## Random Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "We have so far talked about \"statistical variables\". When\n",
    "dealing with uncertain events, we need to use the concept of 'random\n",
    "variables'. Informally (from wikipedia):\n",
    "\n",
    "> A random variable is a variable whose values depend on outcomes of a random phenomenon.\n",
    "\n",
    "A random variable is characterized by a set of possible values often\n",
    "called *sample space*, *probability space*, or *alphabet* (this last term comes from\n",
    "information theory, where we often deal with sources emitting symbols\n",
    "from an alphabet, in which case the values of $X$ will be the symbols).\n",
    "\n",
    "The definition of a random variable is very similar to that of a statistical variable. Formally, if $\\Omega$ is the *sample space*, we will define a random variable as a function:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ X : \\Omega \\to E $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where **E is a measurable space** and often $E=\\mathbb{R}$. This definition is similar to the one of statistical variable we have given before.\n",
    "\n",
    "A random variable is generally denoted by a *capital letter*, such as\n",
    "$X$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to statistical variables, random variables can be *discrete* or *continuous*, *scalar* or *multi-dimensional*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following table lists some examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "||**Discrete**|**Continuous**|\n",
    "|-|-|-|\n",
    "|**Scalar**             | Tossing a coin         | Height of a person|\n",
    "|**Multidimensional**   | Pair of dice           | Coordinates of a car|"

    "### Estimating probabilities from observations\n",
    "\n",
    "What about the cases in which we cannot make any assumption on the equal probability of events? In those cases we would like to estimate probabilities from observations. There are two main approaches to do so: frequentist and Bayesian.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Frequentist approach\n",
    "\n",
    "Probability theory was initially developed to analyze the frequency of\n",
    "events. For instance, it can be used to study events like drawing a\n",
    "certain hand of cards in a poker game. These events are repeatable and\n",
    "can be dealt with using frequencies. In this sense, when we say that an\n",
    "event has probability $p$ of occurring, it means that if we repeat the\n",
    "experiment infinitely many times, then a proportion $p$ of the\n",
    "repetitions would result in that outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the frequentist approach, we can estimate probabilities by\n",
    "repeating an experiment for a large number of times and then computing:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The number of trials: how many times we performed the experiment;\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The number of favorable outcomes: how many times the outcome of the\n",
    "    experiment was favorable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability is hence obtained by dividing the number of favorable\n",
    "outcomes by the number of trials. \n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, let's suppose we want to estimate the probability of\n",
    "obtaining a 'head' by tossing a coin. Let's suppose we toss the coin\n",
    "1000 times and obtain 499 heads and 501 tails. We can compute the\n",
    "probability of obtaining head as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Number of trials: 1000;\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Number of favorable outcomes: 499.\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability of obtaining head will be 499/1000=0.49\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the approach we have seen so far in the course when dealing with relative frequencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The probability of obtaining 'head' when tossing a coin is 0.5. We\n",
    "    know that because, if we toss a coin for a large number of times,\n",
    "    about half of the times, we will obtain 'head';\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The probability of picking a red ball from a box with 40 red balls\n",
    "    and 60 blue balls is 0.4. We know this because, if we repeat the\n",
    "    experiment for a large number of times, we will observe that\n",
    "    proportion.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Bayesian Approach\n",
    "The Bayesian approach to probability offers a different perspective on probability theory. Unlike the frequentist approach, which focuses on analyzing the frequency of events based on observations, the **Bayesian approach allows us to incorporate prior knowledge and update our beliefs as new information becomes available**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Bayesian probability, we view **probability as a measure of uncertainty or belief**. When we assign a probability to an event, it reflects our **subjective degree of belief in the event's likelihood**. This approach is particularly useful when dealing with unique or one-time events where frequency-based analysis may not be applicable (e.g., \"**what is the probability that the sun will extinguish in 5 billion years?**\").\n",
    "\n",
    "We will discuss better the Bayesian approach when we'll discuss Bayes theorem."
